5          DESCRIPTION:  THIS PROGRAM ILLUSTRATES HOW TO CONSTRUCT FAMILY-LEVEL VARIABLES FROM PERSON-LEVEL DATA
6          
7                        THERE ARE TWO DEFINITIONS OF FAMILY UNIT IN MEPS.
8                           1) CPS FAMILY:  ID IS DUID + CPSFAMID.  CORRESPONDING WEIGHT IS FAMWT14C.
9                           2) MEPS FAMILY: ID IS DUID + FAMIDYR.   CORRESPONDING WEIGHT IS FAMWT14F.
10         
11                       THE CPS FAMILY IS USED IN THIS EXERCISE.
