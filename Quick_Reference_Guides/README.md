The following reference guides are provided for convenience:

## Condition Codes

[meps_condition_codes.csv](meps_condition_codes.csv) provides a cross-reference between [collapsed condition categories](https://meps.ahrq.gov/survey_comp/MEPS_condition_data.pdf) commonly used in MEPS analyses and [Clinical Classification Software (CCS) Codes](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp#download).
